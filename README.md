# Apprentice-Now-Coding-Bootcamp
Assignments completed during the duration of the Apprentice Now coding bootcamp


## Film Buddy
This assignment pulls data from my SQL database of film information and then returns the user with the actors from each movie in the database via local website.

## Full Stack Project
This assignment is a login application that checks to see if the user is already registered in the database and if not prompts them to create a login, stores it in the database and then gives them access to the website.
